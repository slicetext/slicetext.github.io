            <h1>First Things to do in Lubuntu</h1>
            <h2>June 24, 2023</h2>
        </div>
		<div class="section">
        <h2>1: Install Nautilus</h2>
        <p>I personally hate the default File Manager, PCMANFM-Qt. Because of this, I like to install
            gnome's default File Manager, Nautilus. This is super easy. Just run <code>sudo apt install nautilus</code>
            in the terminal.
        </p>
        <h2>2: Set your Theme</h2>
        <p>Lubuntu has many different themes. You can find them and choose your favorite in the LXQt
            menu by going to Preferences>LXQt Settings>Appearence. You can change the theme in the
            LXQt Theme section of the menu. I like to use the Lubuntu Arc theme.
        </p>
        <h2>3: Set your Icons to Numix Circle</h2>
        <p>
            I think this icons look very nice. You can use them by opening up the terminal and running
            <code>sudo apt install numix-icon-theme-circle</code>. Then, to apply them, open up the same Appearence
            menu as number 2 and instead navigate to the icon section and select your icons to be Numix Circle.
        </p>
        <h2>4: Change your Panel's Widgets</h2>
        <p>
            To do this, right click on your panel and select Manage Widgets. In this menu, you can press plus to
            add a widget, minus to remove one once you have clicked on it, and the arrows to move the widget you have
            clicked on.
